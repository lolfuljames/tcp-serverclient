# tcp-serverclient
TCP server client based on QOTD Protocol (doesn't return a quote but cool stuff instead)

## Usage

Open terminal in the same folder as the files.

First, we start our TCP server.
```
javac Rfc865TcpServer.java
java Rfc865TcpServer
```

Next, we start running our client.
```
javac Rfc865TcpClient.java
java Rfc865TcpClient
```
